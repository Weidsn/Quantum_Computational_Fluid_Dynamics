Abstract: Solving Poisson equations using a variational quantum algorithm (VQA), i.e., Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Results were not promising. VQLS is further discussed in [5].<br><br>

Abstract: Solving CFD problems by implementing HHL (referred to as a kind of Quantum Linear Systems Algorithm or in other words Quantum Linear Equation Solver QLES) with a discussion of Quantum Postprocessing Protocol (QPP), which concerns information extraction via quantum state measurements.
